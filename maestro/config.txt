#ligand information
#1. it supports multiply ligands in a single `ligand_file`
#2. only one SMARTS string is allowed!
#3. 1st atom of the SMARTS will be bound to the receptor `receptor_staying_atom`
#4. all possible atoms will be searched, and each leads to a complex
#5. all complexes will be saved in one file `complex_out`
